# Attendence-System-Based-on-Face-Recognition-using-opencv
This project will help to managed attendence with help of Face recognition. Authentication is a significant issue in system control in computer based communication. Human face recognition is an important branch of biometric verification and has been widely used in many applications, such as video monitor system , human-computer interaction.The main objective of this project is to present an automated system for human face recognition in a real time background for an organization to mark the attendance of their employees or student. So automated attendance using real time face recognition is a real world solution.
